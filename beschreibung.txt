Landing Page Structure: Achilles Analytics

Design Theme: High-Contrast Dark Mode, fine grid lines, monospace fonts for data points, serif fonts for headlines (authority).

Hero Section: The Mission
Goal: Immediate authority and problem statement. No marketing fluff — operational reality.

Headline: Make the consequences visible — before they occur.

Sub-Headline: Operational decisions are rarely made in clarity. Achilles shifts the moment of insight forward in time, making consequences visible before you commit.

Visual: An abstract, slowly rotating 3D wireframe (derived from the Digital Twin module) that gradually transforms from a chaotic tangle into an ordered structure.

Primary CTA: Request Platform Access

Secondary CTA: Explore the Architecture

The Philosophy: The Blind Spot
Goal: Meet the user where it hurts. Data is not the problem — the missing causality is.

Layout: Two-column. Strong text on the left, subtle animation on the right.

Text Block: "Data exists in abundance, yet it is fragmented. The core blind spot is not a lack of analytics, but the absence of an explicit operational picture."

Key Message: We do not replace intuition with AI — we make decision logic explicit and auditable.

Design Note: This is where the "Glass Effect" should be applied to symbolize transparency.

Core Engine: Impact vs. Vulnerability
Goal: Explain the core technical differentiator — the separation of event reaction and system hardening.

Format: Interactive toggle or split-screen.

State A — Impact Analysis (Reactive)

Question: "How is my system affected by a specific event?"

Output: Calculates the ΔSystem State and displays remaining options.

State B — Vulnerability Analysis (Proactive)

Question: "Where are my structural weaknesses?"

Output: Identifies "Leverage Points" — where small shocks cause large damage.

Table / Graphic: A stylized version of the comparison table from the Primer, reduced to the essentials.

The Intelligence Stack (Module Showcase)
Goal: Show the concrete tools (based on the Fact Sheets). This is where it becomes tangible.

Modules are grouped into logical clusters rather than a flat list:

A. Global Situational Awareness — The Eyes

Crisis Map: Real-time geospatial tracking of conflict zones and heatmaps.

News Hub: AI-curated open-source intelligence stream, filtered for relevance.

Visual: Screenshot of the Mapbox map with a news ticker overlay.

B. Analytical Deep Dive — The Brain

Digital Twin: 3D visualization of complex network relationships and entities.

BIAS Control: Automated detection of political stance and source credibility.

OSINT Atlas: Orchestrated execution of active intelligence gathering tools.

C. Decision Support — The Voice

AI Council (Highlight Feature): Simulated debate between AI personas (Cynic, Optimist, Strategist) to reduce bias.

Intel Report: Automated synthesis of raw data into actionable PDF products.

Spotlight: The AI Council
Goal: This is the signature "cyberpunk" feature. It deserves its own section.

Headline: Escape the Echo Chamber.

Content: "A simulated council of AI agents with distinct personas challenges your assumptions. It does not decide for you — it forces you to see the blind spots."

Visual: A stylized representation of three "heads" or nodes projecting arguments onto a central decision line.

Architecture & Security
Goal: Build trust for enterprise and government clients.

Not a Black Box: Logic is documented and traceable.

Human in the Loop: The system does not decide. It enables informed reassessment.

Admin Oversight: Centralized "Achilles Command" dashboard for total system health monitoring.
