# Roadmap: Achilles Analytics Mobile UI Fix Sprint

## Overview

This roadmap transforms the Achilles Analytics marketing site from desktop-only to fully responsive across all devices. The journey moves section-by-section through the single-page application, adding mobile navigation, touch interactions, and responsive layouts. Each phase completes one vertical slice of the page, ensuring that every section looks polished and intentional from 360px mobile screens to 1440px+ desktops.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3, 4): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.
