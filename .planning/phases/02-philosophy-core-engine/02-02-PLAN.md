<objective>
Optimize CoreEngine panel spacing and margins for mobile viewports.

Purpose: The CoreEngine panel-header has a 40px margin-bottom that wastes vertical space on mobile screens. Reducing this progressively across breakpoints ensures the panels remain compact and readable on smaller viewports.

Output: CoreEngine panels with optimized spacing at all breakpoints

  <action>
    In `src/pages/CoreEngine.css`, add panel-header margin reductions to the EXISTING responsive blocks:

    1. In the EXISTING `@media (max-width: 1024px)` block (around line 631), ADD:
       ```css
       .vg-engine__panel-header {
         margin-bottom: 32px;
       }
       ```

    2. In the EXISTING `@media (max-width: 640px)` block (around line 647), ADD:
       ```css
       .vg-engine__panel-header {
         margin-bottom: 24px;
         gap: 12px;
       }

       .vg-engine__panel-title {
         font-size: 1.4rem;
       }

       .vg-engine__header {
         margin-bottom: 32px;
       }
       ```

    3. Also in the 640px block, the `.vg-engine__viz-badge-text` is 11px with 1px letter-spacing, which can overflow on narrow screens. Add:
       ```css
       .vg-engine__viz-badge-text {
         font-size: 10px;
         letter-spacing: 0.5px;
       }
       ```

    IMPORTANT: Add these rules INSIDE the existing media query blocks. Do NOT create duplicate @media blocks. The existing blocks already have rules — append to them.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - CoreEngine.css 1024px media query contains `.vg-engine__panel-header` with `margin-bottom: 32px`
    - CoreEngine.css 640px media query contains `.vg-engine__panel-header` with `margin-bottom: 24px`
    - Dev server compiles without errors
    - At 360px width: panels have tighter spacing, content is readable, no overflow
  </verify>
  <done>
    CoreEngine panel-header margin reduces from 40px (desktop) to 32px (tablet) to 24px (mobile). Panel titles and badge text scale appropriately. Content remains readable and properly spaced at all viewports.
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
1. Open CoreEngine section at 360px viewport — panels stack vertically with compact spacing
2. Panel headers have reduced gap between icon and content area
3. Badge text "Structural Bottleneck Detected" fits within viz area on mobile
4. Resize from 360px through 1024px+ — spacing transitions smoothly
5. No regressions on desktop layout (panels still side-by-side, 40px header margin)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Panel-header margin-bottom is 32px at 1024px and 24px at 640px
- Panel title font-size reduces on mobile
- Section header margin-bottom reduces on mobile
- Badge text fits within container on 360px screens
- Desktop layout unchanged
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-philosophy-core-engine/02-02-SUMMARY.md`
