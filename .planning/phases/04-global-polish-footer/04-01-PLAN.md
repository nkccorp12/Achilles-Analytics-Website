<objective>
Polish AICouncil section for mobile: ensure SVG visualization remains readable at small viewports, add max-width constraint to synthesis overlay to prevent horizontal overflow, and verify all mobile breakpoints produce intentional layouts.

Purpose: Satisfies COUNCIL-01 (SVG readable on mobile) and COUNCIL-02 (synthesis overlay centered on all viewports).
Output: Updated AICouncil.css with mobile-safe synthesis overlay and verified SVG scaling.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: AICouncil synthesis overlay mobile constraint and SVG readability</name>
  <files>src/pages/AICouncil.css</files>
  <action>
    Add max-width constraint to the synthesis overlay on mobile to prevent horizontal overflow. This follows the established Phase 3 pattern (IntelStack alerts panel: "Absolutely positioned panels need max-width constraints on mobile: calc(100% - margins)").

    In the existing `@media (max-width: 640px)` block (line 601), add:

    ```css
    .vg-council__synthesis {
      max-width: calc(100% - 32px);
      left: 50%;
      transform: translateX(-50%);
    }
    ```

    This ensures the overlay stays centered and within bounds on narrow screens. The `left: 50%` + `translateX(-50%)` pattern explicitly centers the absolute-positioned overlay regardless of flex context behavior.

    Also in the same 640px block, add reduced padding for persona cards on mobile to prevent cramped text:

    ```css
    .vg-council__card {
      padding: 12px;
    }

    .vg-council__card-title--cynic,
    .vg-council__card-title--strategist,
    .vg-council__card-title--optimist {
      font-size: 1.1rem;
    }

    .vg-council__card-quote {
      font-size: 0.875rem;
    }
    ```

    Also in the 640px block, ensure the synthesis label letter-spacing reduces to prevent overflow on small screens:

    ```css
    .vg-council__synthesis-label {
      letter-spacing: 2px;
      font-size: 11px;
    }
    ```

    Verify the existing min-height: 260px on `.vg-council__center` at 640px is sufficient for SVG readability. The SVG uses viewBox="0 0 600 400" with preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet", so at 260px height the shapes (60px diamonds, 35px circle) scale to roughly 39px and 23px respectively — visually distinct. Leave as-is.

    Do NOT change the existing 1024px tablet breakpoint rules — they are already correct.
    Do NOT modify AICouncil.jsx — this is CSS-only work.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Open the dev server and inspect AICouncil section at 360px, 640px, and 1024px viewport widths:
    - At 360px: Synthesis overlay should be centered with visible padding on both sides, no horizontal scrollbar
    - At 360px: SVG shapes (diamond, square, circle) should be visually distinct
    - At 640px: Cards should have readable text with proper spacing
    - At 1024px: Grid collapses to single column, stats bar stacks vertically
    - No horizontal overflow at any width between 320px-1440px
  </verify>
  <done>
    Synthesis overlay centered on mobile with max-width constraint. Persona cards have reduced but readable sizing. SVG visualization remains visually distinct at 260px min-height. No horizontal overflow on any viewport.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Open browser DevTools, set viewport to 360px width
- Scroll to AI Council section
- Confirm: SVG shapes visible and distinct (red diamond, blue square, green circle)
- Confirm: Synthesis overlay ("Synthesis Result" / strategy name / confidence) centered with side margins
- Confirm: No horizontal scrollbar appears
- Resize to 640px, 1024px, 1440px — layout transitions smoothly at each breakpoint
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. AI Council SVG visualization scales and remains readable on 360px screens (COUNCIL-01)
2. Synthesis overlay is horizontally centered and does not overflow on any viewport (COUNCIL-02)
3. Persona cards remain readable with appropriate text sizing on mobile
4. No regressions to desktop layout at 1024px+
</success_criteria>
